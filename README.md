# Counter

A simple web page with a counter that can be incremented and decremented using buttons. It utilizes Alpine.js for the interactive functionality.

## Overview

This HTML file creates a basic counter application. It displays a numerical count on the screen and provides two buttons: "increaser" and "decreaser". Clicking these buttons will increase or decrease the displayed count, respectively. The current count value is also logged to the browser's console each time it changes.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For the basic structure and content of the web page.
* **CSS:** For minimal styling to center the elements and provide basic button appearance.
* **Alpine.js:** A lightweight JavaScript framework that provides the reactive behavior for the counter functionality. It's included via CDN.

## How to Use

1.  Save the provided HTML code as an `.html` file (e.g., `counter.html`).
2.  Open the HTML file in any web browser.
3.  You will see a page with the text "Count: 0" and two buttons labeled "increaser" and "decreaser".
4.  Click the "increaser" button to increase the count by one. The displayed number will update, and the new value will be logged to the browser's developer console.
5.  Click the "decreaser" button to decrease the count by one. The displayed number will update, and the new value will be logged to the browser's developer console.

## Key Features

* **Simple Counter:** Displays a numerical value that can be manipulated.
* **Increment Button:** Increases the counter value by one on each click.
* **Decrement Button:** Decreases the counter value by one on each click.
* **Real-time Update:** The displayed count updates immediately upon clicking the buttons.
* **Console Logging:** The updated count value is logged to the browser's console for debugging or monitoring.
* **Lightweight:** Uses Alpine.js, a small and efficient JavaScript framework.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply open the `counter.html` file in your web browser. The Alpine.js library is included directly from a CDN.
